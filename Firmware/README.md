The challenge is composed by several parts that will be explained after. The goal is to learn how to create a project, how to read a hardware datasheet, and how to solve a problem. For this challenge will be used the hardware "PCB_formacao_1v0".

The challenge will be separated into three parts:
- [First challenge](First_challenge/)
- [Second challenge](Second_challenge/)
- (Optional) [Extra challenge](Extra_challenge/)
